# replay-to-mp4-bot
Automatically takes a replay file from a game and converts it to a mp4 file

You provide the game replay files and the bot will record the game files in a seperate folder.
It will automatically rename all the mp4 files to the appropriate names to match the original 
files as well after the recording is done.

Features:
- Reads any songs with mods and adjusts the songs length
- Can display all song lengths / mod types
- Renames files
- Records and converts gameplay to mp4

this file is not the full bot script as I want it private but here is a snippet for
some sort of reference for myself and others viewing.
